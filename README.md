# Python4ChemistryTools
My personal Python toolbox for theoretical chemistry.

- supercell.py: Generate Supercell from xyz-Trajectory file, can be used as module or standalone.
- move_atom.py: Move a single atom from an ASE-compatible input around in space and save all resulting coordinates as xyz. Can be used as a script or module.
- geometryAnalyzer: Some functions for geometric analysis of ASE-format molecules and trajectories. Copy functions into your code or import the file.
